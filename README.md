# Yulu-Hypothesis-Testing

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Yulu is Indiaâ€™s leading micro-mobility service provider, which offers unique vehicles for the daily commute. Starting off as a mission to eliminate traffic congestion in India, Yulu provides the safest commute solution through a user-friendly mobile app to enable shared, solo and sustainable commuting.
The company wants to know:
* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market?
* How well those variables describe the electric cycle demands
## 1. ASK

## Questions:
1. Define the Problem Statement, Import the required Libraries and perform Exploratory Data Analysis.
   * Examine dataset structure, characteristics, and statistical summary.
   * Identify missing values and perform Imputation using an appropriate method.
   * Identify and remove duplicate records.
   * Analyze the distribution of Numerical & Categorical variables, separately
   * Check for Outliers and deal with them accordingly.
2. Try establishing a Relationship between the Dependent and Independent Variables.
3. Check if there any significant difference between the no. of bike rides on Weekdays and Weekends?
   * Formulate Null Hypothesis (H0) and Alternate Hypothesis (H1)
   * Select an appropriate test -
   * Set a significance level
   * Calculate test Statistics / p-value
   * Decide whether to accept or reject the Null Hypothesis.
4. Check if the demand of bicycles on rent is the same for different Weather conditions?
   * Formulate Null Hypothesis (H0) and Alternate Hypothesis (H1)
   * Select an appropriate test -
   * Check assumptions of the test
     1. Normality
     2. Equality Variance
   * Set a significance level and Calculate the test Statistics / p-value.
   * Decide whether to accept or reject the Null Hypothesis.
5. Check if the demand of bicycles on rent is the same for different Seasons?
   * Formulate Null Hypothesis (H0) and Alternate Hypothesis (H1)
   * Select an appropriate test -
   * Check assumptions of the test
     1. Normality
     2. Equality Variance
   * Set a significance level and Calculate the test Statistics / p-value.
   * Decide whether to accept or reject the Null Hypothesis.

## Data Storage:
This public dataset is completely available on open source platform where it stores and consolidates all available datasets for analysis. The specific individual datasets at hand can be obtained at this link below:https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/001/428/original/bike_sharing.csv?1642089089
## Tools Used:
1. Google_Collab

## 3. ACT
## Recommendations:
1. I will recommend that the company must provide different vehicles for different seasons and weathers.So that the revenue does not get
negatively impacted.
2. The renting prices for diffeent vehicles should not impact the pocket of customer,so that they could not hesitate to rent vehicles other
then bike.
